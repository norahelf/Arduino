The first game, LED_Game, has 4 LEDs which blink in a predictable order. As it cycles through the LEDs, the player's job is to press their switch button when the one green LED is blinking. When a player presses their switch button while the green light is flashing, they receive a point. It can be played with two players and the game resets when you reach 10 points. 

The second game, LED_Game_Random, does the same thing except it has a buzzer that goes off once if player 1 wins, twice if player 2 wins, and 3 times if they tie. Also, the LEDs blink randomly.
