This game has 4 LEDs which blink in a predictable order. As it cycles through the LEDs, the player's job is to press their switch button when the one green LED is blinking. When a player presses their switch button while the green light is flashing, they receive a point. It can be played with two players and the game resets when you reach 10 points.
