# Arduino
This game has 4 LEDs which blink in a predictable order. As it cycles through the LEDs, the player's job is to press the switch button when the one green light is blinking. When a player presses their switch button when the green light is flashing, they receive points. It can be played with two players and the game resets when you reach 10 points.
